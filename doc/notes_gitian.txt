The Linux, Windows and Mac executables are compiled on linux.

For deterministic builds, the chosen linux operating system is 64-bit Debian
Precise. All accompanying scripts are tailored to this assumption. Moreover
whether or not you have a machine running 64-bit Debian Precise, compile
using a virtual instance. The idea is to use LXC to create a virtual image
within the virtual image and do the compiling within that nested image.

Download and Install Virtual Box from
  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Download amd64 Debian ISO from
  https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst.

You cannot run virtual box for 64-bit instances on
   a 32-bit machine,
   a machine which Virtualization isn't enabled in the BIOS, or
   on machines which are already virutalized (e.g., AWS instances).

If you are on a local windows machine which cannot run 64-bit instances but have
access to a remote 64-bit linux instance in which you have installed virtualbox:
  install cygwin and putty.
  start an cygwin X server with "startx"
  ssh into your remote linux machine using "ssh -XY -l user host"
  run "VirtualBox"

Follow the instructions on
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md
Do not count on the nested image being able to have access to the internet.
Therefore the line
  make -C ../bitcoin/depends download SOURCES_PATH=`pwd`/cache/common
to make the dependencies is must be done before the build.
